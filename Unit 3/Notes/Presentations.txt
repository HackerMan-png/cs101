Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
How to tell if the application is vulnerable
If you are unaware of what components you are using
This applies to both the client and server sides and direct compoenents as well as nested dependencies
Test regularly
Are the underlying platforms updated?
If you do not secure the components configurations

How to prevent
Frequently check for vulerabilities
Test code compatibilty
update any outdated software
Only obtain website compnents from reputable sources
Path any old vulnerabilities
Know what componenets and which version you are using
Don't use open source components unless you know ways to patch vulnerabilities

Example Attack Scenarios
Poorly encrypted password database
If source code gets leaked, hackers can look right at the code and see the vulnerabilities

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Misconfiguration is when a device or application's security protocols are either:
    Not set up
    Set up but not well
This can lead to countless data breaches in even some of the biggest companies.

Your application may be vulnerable if:
    You're missing the appropritate system hardening
    The software is out of date
    You have insufficient firewall protection

How do you prevent it?
    Harding is going into a device and providing the best security you can without an antivirus software.
    This includes: closing ports, uninstalling pointless freatures, and configuring a firewall.
    When system hardening, your goal is to reduce security risk and decrease your "attack surface" otherwise known as the points that an attacker could try to enter from.

Close unnecessary ports
A port is basically a door into the network, so closing any that you don't use is like locking the window so burglars can't get in.

Update your applications
Many applications have minor breaches and those are fixed in minor updates, so be sure to keep up to date to fix these issues.

Configure your firewall
This is a part of hardening but is important enough to warrant it's own slide. hardening your device will provide the best security you can get without installing 3rd party softwares.
